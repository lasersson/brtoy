Toy engine for experiments.

Contains an example of GPU driven rendering which uses a global
gometry buffer to store all mesh data. Does a simple frustum cull on the GPU and spits out a
single draw call which draws everything.


Building and running

Only Windows supported. Requires CMake, might work with Visual Studio's embedded CMake and
"Open -> Folder...". Only tested with MSVC 19 (Visual Studio 2022). For building from
command line (make sure your compiler is on the PATH):

 1. Init git submodules: git submodule update --init --recursive
 2. Configure: cmake --preset win-rel
 3. Build: cmake --build build/win-rel
    Takes a while first run because of building dependencies from source
 4. Run from the otput bin dir:
    cd build/win-rel/bin
    ./example_gpu_driven_rendering.exe
